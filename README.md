# LyricSpot

Small Python app that synchronizes the lyrics of your Spotify songs. Useful to learn songs / sing along.
Created thanks to these dependencies:
  - tekore: https://github.com/felix-hilden/tekore
  - spotify-lyrics-api: https://github.com/akashrchandran/spotify-lyrics-api
  - tkinter: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

How to use:

- Unzip the folder and open LyricSpot.exe.
- Enter your Spotify API Client credentials (or use mine) (it doesn't matter if the callback URL doesn't exist).

- Authorize your spotify account, and once done, copy the redirected URL and paste it.

If everything goes fine, a session.cfg file will be created in the .exe directory. This will save the session for future uses, delete it if you want to
access with another configuration/account.

You can add a delay or anticipation to lyrics if the synchronization is a bit off in the current song. The default value works fine for most songs.
